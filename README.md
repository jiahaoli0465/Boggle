# Boggle Game

Welcome to the Boggle Game, a dynamic web-based version of the classic Boggle word game! This application brings the challenging fun of Boggle right to your browser, where you can play and compete against yourself to beat your high score across different difficulty levels.

## Impressive Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enjoy a fully interactive Boggle experience with a sleek, user-friendly interface. The game is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing you to focus solely on finding words.
  
- **Real-Time Word Validation**: Utilizing asynchronous JavaScript (Ajax), the game provides immediate feedback on word submissions without any page reloads, delivering a seamless gaming experience.

- **Difficulty Levels**: Cater to all player skill levels by choosing between Easy, Hard, or Impossible modes, each with varying time limits to test your speed and word-finding abilities.

- **Persistent High Scores**: Keep track of your progress and achievements with session-based high score tracking. Aim to beat your own best scores in each difficulty setting.

## What Makes This Project Stand Out?

- **Modern Web Technologies**: This project is built using Flask, a lightweight and powerful web framework for Python, showcasing modern backend development practices.

- **Client-Server Interaction**: The game demonstrates real-time client-server communication using Ajax, without the need to refresh the webpage, providing an excellent example of asynchronous web development.

- **Algorithmic Complexity**: The Boggle game logic incorporates complex algorithms for board generation and word search, which are great showcases of problem-solving and efficiency.
